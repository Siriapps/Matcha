# Matcha ☕

**Brewing your perfect hack team**

Matcha is a team matching platform designed specifically for hackathons. It connects developers, designers, and visionaries to form high-impact teams that build projects that matter.

## What is Matcha?

Matcha helps you find the right teammates for the right hackathon. Instead of scrambling at the last minute or working solo, Matcha uses intelligent matching to connect you with compatible team members based on your skills, interests, and hackathon experience.

## Why Matcha?

### 🎯 **Find Your Perfect Squad**
No more awkward team formations or working alone. Matcha matches you with teammates who complement your skills and share your interests.

### ⚡ **Quick Team Formation**
Paste a Devpost or hackathon URL, and Matcha instantly starts the matching process. No lengthy forms or complicated setup—just paste and go.

### 🎨 **Skill-Based Matching**
Our algorithm considers your preferred roles (Frontend, Backend, ML, Design), experience level, technical skills, and interests to find the best team fit.

### 💬 **Built-in Communication**
Once matched, start chatting with your potential teammates directly in the app. No need to exchange contact info or switch platforms.

### 📊 **Track Your Hack History**
Keep a record of all your hackathon projects, teams, and achievements in one place. See your growth over time and showcase your best work.
